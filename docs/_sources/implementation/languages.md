DSP theory and algorithms can be studied from a purely mathematical 
perspective with minimal computing or programming background. However, a more 
holistic perspective acknowledges tradeoffs between signal quality and 
implementation complexity. 

Although some DSP systems are implemented in assembly or hardware description 
languages, it is more common to use a low level programming language like C. 
high level languages are often used for prototyping and simulation of DSP 
algorithms.

If you are not comfortable with programming, don't worry! Computing and DSP 
are complementary; a great way to demystify DSP algorithms is by implementing 
them in software, and great way to learn software design patterns is by 
implementing DSP algorithms.

In this course, we will develop the embedded implementation in [C](#c). 
Prototyping and simulation can be done using either 
[Julia](#julia), [Python](#python), or [MATLAB](#matlab).

## Popular languages for DSP

A variety of sources have tracked the popularity of programming languages over 
time, usually in the form of developer surveys.

# C

The C programming language has consistently ranked among the top languages for 
decades. Currently, C is popular for embedded systems, operating systems, and 
high performance/supercomputer applications.

# Python

Python is currently the most popular general purpose programming language.
Unlike C, python has a package manager which simplifies development, 
especially for simulations.

# Julia

Julia is one of the fastest growing languages. It is increasingly used in
education and industry, especially for high-performance computing and 
machine learning applications.

# MATLAB

MATLAB is commercial software. Many textbooks, especially in the field of 
signal processing, use MATLAB since it offers a set of interoperable, 
application-specific toolboxes for everything from filter design to
embedded code generation.
